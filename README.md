# About
Robo is a small set of tools for android projects that use ant. 

It reads the project's Android.xml file and adds some commands and 
shortcuts to vim.

# Installation
Either use something like pathogen or copy the files in your .vim directory.

# Initialization 
:RoboInit will ask you for the manifest file and activate the plugin.

:RoboUnInit should deactivate the script and remove all the commands except
the RoboInit command.

# Docs
:help robo

something or more direct like 

:help RoboGoToActivity
