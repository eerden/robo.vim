# About

succesfully reading the Android.xml file it adds some commands and 
someshortcuts.


# Installation

Either use something like pathogen or copy the files in your .vim directory.


# Initialization 
                  
:RoboInit will start and ask you for the manifest file.

:RoboUnInit should deactivate the script and remove all the commands except
the RoboInit command.
